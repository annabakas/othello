1. This past week I worked on Milestone 3. I spent a couple days working on placing the computer's valid moves on a temporary board and then seeing what the players' valid moves would be afterwards. However, I ran into some problems because the computer would just place a counter at (0,0). So, I backtracked and decided to start more simply with the computer choosing a valid move that is the highest score among the array of valid moves. I do this work in computer.c/h. In decision(), I loop through all the computer's valid moves. In addition to decision(), I created copy_board() that copies one board into another. While looping through the computer's valid moves, I copy the current state of the board into a temporary board. I then place one of the computer's valid moves on the temporary board and get the score afterwarsd. In set_high(), I determine if that score is greater than the current maximum score. If it is, I assign the valid move row to best_row and the valid move column to best_col. Once I am done looping through the valid moves for the computer, I pass the best_row and best_col to make_move(). I also created a couple more tests in othello_tests. In Copied, I test that the copy_board() correctly copies one board into another. In SetHighScore, I test that if the temporary score from a valid move is greater than the max, then update the max to the temporary score. In NotHighScore, I test that if the temporary score from a valid move is less than the current max score, then don't update the max score.
2. This week I will continue working on Milestone 3. I want to work on determining the player's moves/score after the computer makes one of its valid moves. I will do this in computer.c.
