1. This past week I worked on Milestone 2. Before working on human vs. human play, I had to fix my struct and where it was used because I didn't have the matrix in the struct. I was able to resolve this and then start on human vs. human play. othello.c acts as my main with the gameplay occuring there. Users are shown their score and the gameboard on each turn. The game switches between two players using if-else. On the gameboard, players are shown where they can place a piece. This is marked with an asterisk. Each user is prompted to enter coordinates during their turn. This is done with prompt_move() in player.c. Finding and storing what moves are valid is done in player.c. Placing a player's piece is done in logic.c. Also in logic.c is get_winner() which displays the winner at the end of gameplay. In gameboard.c, players' scores are calculated with getScore(), playable squares are displayed with a playable_squares() that sets where valid moves are on the gameboard. Playable squares are then reset back to empty with clear_playable() after a user has made their move. I created couple more tests that test if a user's coordinate input is stored correctly and if the correct winner is returned.
2. This week I am going to start working on Milestone 3 with human vs. computer play and the look ahead tree.
