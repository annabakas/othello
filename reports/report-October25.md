1. This week I worked on Milestone 2. I worked on human vs. human play. othello.c acts as my main with the gameplay occuring there. Users are shown their score and the gameboard on each turn. On the gameboard, they are shown where they can place a piece. Each user is prompted to enter coordinates during their turn. Finding and storing what moves are valid is done in player.c and placing a player's piece is doing in logic.c. In gameboard.c, players' scores are calculated with getScore(), playable squares are displayed with a function that sets coordinates of valid moves with aan asterisk. Playable squares are then reset back to empty with a function after a user has made their move.
