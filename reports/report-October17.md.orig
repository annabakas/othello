1. This week I worked on Milestone 1. I set up my abstract data type for the gameboard. In the struct is char color which represents the piece, either an X or an 0, for the players. I also created functions for the gameboard such as initializing a new gameboard, copying the gameboard into another, displaying the gameboard, checking if the gameboard was full, comparing two gameboards, and seeing a position entered by a user is a valid one. I also created unit test for some of these functions. One unit test tests that the board is not full at the start of a new game, another unit test tests that the board was initialized with four center pieces, another test tests that non center pieces are blank, and another test tests that a position entered is valid or not. I also created player.c and player.h files.
2. This upcoming week, I want to start working on Milestone 2 with the human vs. human play. I want to learn the logic of the game more and how it is played. I will continue to add onto the player.h and player.c files, make more unit tests, and create other .c and .h files for the logic/game play.
